#### Repo Description <br>
​
The GoFit-Project repository encompasses a collection of folders, assets, and forms designed to create web pages for various functionalities. It includes everything needed for most pages, except for the signup, sign-in, and forgot password folders, which have their own specific contents. Within the assets folder, you'll find sub-folders containing CSS styles, font families, and images used for the front-end presentation. <br>
The repository also hosts PHP files that correspond to their respective HTML pages, ensuring compatibility with our user registration system. Key PHP files include settings.php, signin.php, signup.php, contact.php, chatbot.php, and logout.php. These files serve as the backbone for common functionality provided to our users. <br>
